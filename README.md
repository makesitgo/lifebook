> "The world keeps spinning, and the tales keep turning, and people come and people go, but they're never forgotten. And the one truth we know, it held true one more time... That love, true love, the really, really good kind of love never dies."  

welcome to lifebook ... go write your own stories.

### background

an application born out of a conversation with the love of my life, to serve as a means for preserving and remembering life's very special moments as simply as possible.

your lifebook is your life's book.  at it's most basic, it should be considered a memory repository.  at it's most utilized, your memories become shared moments.  shared across the various aspects of your own life.  shared amongst the many others' lifebooks you interact with every day.

#### memories

consider these like a blog entry to your life.  they can take many forms: a journal entry, sketches, photos, videos.  they exist in a flat structure in your lifebook, but can be stitched together through your (and your companions') life aspects.

#### aspects

consider these like epics or sagas to your life.  some may live on forever, some may have just been phases.  you can close aspects out and revive them later on.  aspects can have aspects, and memories associated with an aspect are inherently associated with any and all parent aspects.

#### companions

consider these as those in your life that also maintain a lifebook.  when you connect with companions, you open your life to them and can open your book to them as well.  together, you can create shared memories, shared aspects, and shared lives.
